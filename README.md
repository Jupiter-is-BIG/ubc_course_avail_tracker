# UBC_course_avail_tracker
It's a python project — utilizing `BeautifulSoup4` and `lxml` — to scarpe data from the website of University of British Columbia every `5 seconds` and `beeps` whenever the course you demand for has seats available.
In `scrape.py`, register the courses/labs you want to keep track of under the `myInterest` `list` and execute the program.
